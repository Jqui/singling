Singling 1.0.0 for 1.13d
By Jonathan Vasquez (FearedBliss)
Released on Tuesday, September 17, 2013
------------------------------------------------

This is a light addon to improve the Single Player experience. The below features are just things that the
Single Player Forum (SPF) at Diablo IncGamers already accept, plus the addition of the character experience 
ratios used pre-1.10. This means that after level 70, a character will get 100% experience off the monster kill. 

** ! Everything else in the game remains Vanilla ! **

Overall this serves as a consolidation of FAM (Forum Accepted Mods).

Features:
-----------------

- Experience Ratio has been fixed to not diminish after level 70. 
  * Meaning you will always get 100% experience from the monster.

- Ladder Runewords are now enabled/unlocked and can be used on Single Player.

- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II.
