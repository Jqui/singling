Singling 1.0.1 for 1.13d
By Jonathan Vasquez (FearedBliss)
Released on Tuesday, September 17, 2013
------------------------------------------------

This is a light addon to improve the Single Player experience. The below features are just things that the
Single Player Forum (SPF) at Diablo IncGamers already accept.

This addon is literally Vanilla D2 + Runeword Mod + The Modified Dll all bundled up into a single zip.

Overall this serves as a consolidation of FAM (Forum Accepted Mods).

Features:
-----------------

- Ladder Runewords are now enabled/unlocked and can be used on Single Player.

- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II.
